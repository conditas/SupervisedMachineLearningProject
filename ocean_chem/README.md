Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms for Ocean Acidification Modeling

In this project I  compare the performance of three different machine learning regression algorithms in using ocean chemistry data to predict pH levels. I compare Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression and Decision Tree Regression algorithms.

This is my final project for DTSA 5509- Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning

I have included the Jupyter Notebook (Ocean_Chem.ipynb) for the project and corresponding data files (.csv). I aslo have included a pdf version of the project (Ocean_Chem.pdf).
